## Prerequisites

- Pip

> ðŸ“˜ Note
> 
> You can download pip [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).

## Sample Code

You can find the sample code [here](https://github.com/Nomad-Media/samples-python).

## Nomad SDK PIP

To learn how to download and setup the nomad sdk pip, go to [Nomad SDK PIP](https://github.com/Nomad-Media/nomad-sdk/tree/main/nomad-sdk-pip).

## Setup

To run the sample code, you need to add a `config.py` file in the root directory of the sample code. The `config.py` file should contain the following code:

```python
config = {
    "username": "username",
    "password": "password",
    "serviceApiUrl": "serviceApiUrl",
    "apiType": "admin",
    "debugMode": False
}
```
